# Goals
Goals This activity will not only allow you to add a highly useful function to
your collection, but it will also teach you an important concept in C
programming: static variables.

# Common Instructions
Common Instructions • Your project must be written in C.  • Your project must be
written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus files/functions, they are
included in the norm check, and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error.
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error,
double free, etc.) except for undefined behavior. If this occurs, your project
will be considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.  •
All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed when necessary. Memory leaks
will not be tolerated.  • If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile
that compiles your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall,
-Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.  Additionally, your Makefile must not perform
unnecessary relinking.  • Your Makefile must contain at least the rules $(NAME),
all, clean, fclean and re.  • To submit bonuses for your project, you must
include a bonus rule in your Makefile, which will add all the various headers,
libraries, or functions that are not allowed in the main part of the project.
Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless the subject specifies
otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is conducted separately.
• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and
its associated Makefile into a libft folder. Your project’s Makefile must
compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.  • We
encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work
does not need to be submitted and will not be graded. It will give you an
opportunity to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find these
tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are
free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.  •
Submit your work to the assigned Git repository. Only the work in the Git
repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it
will occur 3

after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work
during Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

# AI Instructions
AI Instructions ● Context This project is designed to help you discover the
fundamental building blocks of your ICT training.  To properly anchor key
knowledge and skills, it’s essential to adopt a thoughtful approach to using AI
tools and support.  True foundational learning requires genuine intellectual
effort — through challenge, repetition, and peer-learning exchanges.  For a more
complete overview of our stance on AI — as a learning tool, as part of the ICT
curriculum, and as an expectation in the job market — please refer to the
dedicated FAQ on the intranet.

● Main message ☛ Build strong foundations without shortcuts.  ☛ Really develop
tech & power skills.  ☛ Experience real peer-learning, start learning how to
learn and solve new problems.  ☛ The learning journey is more important than the
result.  ☛ Learn about the risks associated with AI, and develop effective
control practices and countermeasures to avoid common pitfalls.

● Learner rules: • You should apply reasoning to your assigned tasks, especially
before turning to AI.

Reading a line from a file descriptor is way too tedious.

• You should not ask for direct answers to the AI.  • You should learn about 42
global approach on AI.

● Phase outcomes: Within this foundational phase, you will get the following
outcomes: • Get proper tech and coding foundations.  • Know why and how AI can
be dangerous during this phase.

● Comments and example: • Yes, we know AI exists — and yes, it can solve your
projects. But you’re here to learn, not to prove that AI has learned. Don’t
waste your time (or ours) just to demonstrate that AI can solve the given
problem.  • Learning at 42 isn’t about knowing the answer — it’s about
developing the ability to find one. AI gives you the answer directly, but that
prevents you from building your own reasoning. And reasoning takes time, effort,
and involves failure. The path to success is not supposed to be easy.  • Keep in
mind that during exams, AI is not available — no internet, no smartphones, etc.
You’ll quickly realise if you’ve relied too heavily on AI in your learning
process.  • Peer learning exposes you to different ideas and approaches,
improving your interpersonal skills and your ability to think divergently.
That’s far more valuable than just chatting with a bot. So don’t be shy — talk,
ask questions, and learn together!  • Yes, AI will be part of the curriculum —
both as a learning tool and as a topic in itself. You’ll even have the chance to
build your own AI software. In order to learn more about our crescendo approach
you’ll go through in the documentation available on the intranet.  ✓ Good
practice: I’m stuck on a new concept. I ask someone nearby how they approached
it. We talk for 10 minutes — and suddenly it clicks. I get it.  ✗ Bad practice:
I secretly use AI, copy some code that looks right. During peer evaluation, I
can’t explain anything. I fail. During the exam — no AI — I’m stuck again. I
fail.

# Mandatory part
Mandatory part Function name Prototype Turn in files Parameters Return value

External functs.  Description

get_next_line char *get_next_line(int fd); get_next_line.c,
get_next_line_utils.c, get_next_line.h fd: The file descriptor to read from Read
line: correct behavior NULL: there is nothing else to read, or an error occurred
read, malloc, free Write a function that returns a line read from a file
descriptor

• Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should
let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a
time.  • Your function should return the line that was read.  If there is
nothing left to read or if an error occurs, it should return NULL.  • Make sure
that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading
from the standard input.  • Please note that the returned line should include
the terminating \n character, except when the end of the file is reached and the
file does not end with a \n character.  • Your header file get_next_line.h must
at least contain the prototype of the get_next_line() function.  • Add all the
helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.

A good start would be to know what a static variable is.

Get Next Line

Reading a line from a file descriptor is way too tedious.

• Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to
your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be adjusted by your peer evaluators and the
Moulinette to test your code.

We must be able to compile this project with and without the -D BUFFER_SIZE flag
in addition to the usual flags. You may choose any default value you prefer.

• You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an
example): cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c • get_next_line()
exhibits undefined behavior if the file associated with the file descriptor is
modified after the last call, while read() has not yet reached the end of the
file.  • get_next_line() also exhibits undefined behavior when reading a binary
file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you
want to.

Does your function still work if the BUFFER_SIZE value is 9999?  it is 1?
10000000? Do you know why?

If

Try to read as little as possible each time get_next_line() is called. If you
encounter a new line, you have to return the current line.  Don’t read the whole
file and then process each line.

Forbidden • You are not allowed to use your libft in this project.  • lseek() is
forbidden.  • Global variables are forbidden.

# Readme Requirements
Readme Requirements A README.md file must be provided at the root of your Git
repository. Its purpose is to allow anyone unfamiliar with the project (peers,
staff, recruiters, etc.) to quickly understand what the project is about, how to
run it, and where to find more information on the topic.  The README.md must
include at least: • The very first line must be italicized and read: This
project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by <login1>[, <login2>[,
<login3>[...]]].  • A “Description” section that clearly presents the project,
including its goal and a brief overview.  • An “Instructions” section containing
any relevant information about compilation, installation, and/or execution.  • A
“Resources” section listing classic references related to the topic
(documentation, articles, tutorials, etc.), as well as a description of how AI
was used — specifying for which tasks and which parts of the project.  ➠
Additional sections may be required depending on the project (e.g., usage
examples, feature list, technical choices, etc.).  Any required additions will
be explicitly listed below.  • A detailed explanation and justification of the
algorithm selected for this project must also be included.

Chapter VI
# Bonus part
Bonus part This project is straightforward and does not support complex bonus
features. However, we trust your creativity. If you have completed the mandatory
part, consider attempting this bonus section.  Here are the bonus part
requirements: • Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.  • Your
get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.  For
example, if you are reading from file descriptors 3, 4, and 5, you should be
able to read from a different file descriptor with each call, without losing
track of the reading state of each file descriptor or returning a line from a
different one.  This means you should be able to call get_next_line() to read
from fd 3, then fd 4, then fd 5, then again from fd 3, then fd 4, and so forth,
without losing track of the reading state for each file descriptor.  Append the
_bonus.[c\h] suffix to the bonus part files.  It means that, in addition to the
mandatory part files, you will turn in the 3 following files: •
get_next_line_bonus.c • get_next_line_bonus.h • get_next_line_utils_bonus.c

The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is perfect. "Perfect"
means the mandatory part has been integrally done and works without
malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the mandatory requirements, your
bonus part will not be evaluated at all.


Chapter VII
# Submission and peer-evaluation
Submission and peer-evaluation Submit your assignment in your Git repository as
usual. Only the content inside your repository will be evaluated during the
defense. Make sure to double-check the file names for accuracy.

When writing your tests, remember that: 1) Both the buffer size and the line
size can be of very different values.  2) A file descriptor does not only point
to regular files.  Be thorough and cross-check your work with your peers.
Prepare a comprehensive set of diverse tests for the defense.

Once passed, do not hesitate to add your get_next_line() to your libft.  During
the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be
requested. This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to
write or rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.  While this step may not be
applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it if it is mentioned in
the evaluation guidelines.  This step is meant to verify your actual
understanding of a specific part of the project.  The modification can be
performed in any development environment you choose (e.g., your usual setup),
and it should be feasible within a few minutes — unless a specific timeframe is
defined as part of the evaluation.  You can, for example, be asked to make a
small update to a function or script, modify a display, or adjust a data
structure to store new information, etc.  The details (scope, target, etc.) will
be specified in the evaluation guidelines and may vary from one evaluation to
another for the same project.
